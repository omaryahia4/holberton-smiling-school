# holberton-smiling-school :
In this project, i will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. i will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges that i learned previously.

i don't have a lot of instruction, i'm free to implement it the way that i want.
the objective is simple: 
-   Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.
